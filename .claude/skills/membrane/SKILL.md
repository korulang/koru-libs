name: membrane
description: Tend the membrane memory corpus — an OKF concept store whose fragment evolution lives in the git log as lineage trailers. Fire when creating, evolving, merging, splitting, or CORRECTING durable memory/knowledge that lives as OKF files under git; when recording how a belief changed or was repudiated; or when tracing a concept's history through time. YOU are the evolver — there is no evolution engine and no LLM sidecar. NOT for transient notes, scratch, or code comments.

# membrane — memory as a disciplined git log over OKF

The membrane is a memory corpus with one move: **the agent updates the knowledge,
and in the same act records how it evolved — into the git log.** There is no
fragment-evolution engine, no proprietary store, no required embedding model. The
intelligence (which concept is this? evolve or correct? what's the lineage?) is a
**judgment you make as you write**, not a technology. git is the temporal ledger;
OKF is the on-disk shape; you are the evolver.

## The ambition — read this first, it decides everything

We are **not encoding truth.** We are encoding an *iteratively improving
approximation* of truth. A wrong belief was a legitimate prior state of the
approximation; the correction is itself fallible. Three consequences, load-bearing:

- **Nothing is deleted.** Ever.
- **History is never rewritten.** No rebase, no force-push, no amend of landed
  commits. (The value-tickets, replay, and content-addressing all depend on
  immutability — and the record of having been wrong is part of the honest
  approximation.)
- **Correction is always a *forward* commit** that *marks* the past, never erases
  it. The corpus improves by accumulating forward corrections.

## The store

- One concept = one OKF markdown file, keyed by a **stable opaque id**, not by its
  text: `concepts/frag-<id>.md`. The id never changes as the belief evolves —
  identity is the filename; the belief is the body.
- Frontmatter: `type`, `id`, `provenance`, `ts` (+ optional `tags`, `resource`).
  Body = the current belief, in prose.
- The **working tree** is the live corpus (current beliefs). **git history** is
  everything that's been occluded or repudiated — reachable, never gone.

## The five-verb lineage discipline

Every commit to the corpus carries a trailer block. The verb is the judgment.

```
<verb>(<id>): <one-line summary>

Action:     create | evolve | merge | split | correct
Concept:    frag-<id>                 # the resulting/affected concept
Occludes:   <blob-sha>                # evolve ONLY — the prior belief's blob (reachable)
Parents:    frag-<id>[, frag-<id>...] # merge/split ONLY — the lineage DAG edge
Severs:     frag-<id>@<blob-sha>      # correct ONLY — the repudiated lineage point
Reason:     <why the prior line was wrong>   # correct ONLY
Provenance: <session / conversation / source of this update>
Signal:     <type> [value=<n>] [<note>]     # zero or more — the WMFX faucet (see below)
Signals:    none                            # REQUIRED if there are no Signal: lines
```

Choosing the verb:

- **create** — a new belief that doesn't belong to any existing concept.
- **evolve** — an existing concept, *superseded but was-valid*: the world moved,
  the belief refined. `Occludes:` the prior blob. *("Walls were sage; I repainted
  them white.")*
- **merge** — two concepts are actually one. One commit deletes both source files,
  writes the unified one; `Parents:` lists both (both occluded by this commit).
- **split** — one concept is actually two distinct beliefs. `Parents:` the original.
- **correct** — an existing concept was *wrong* — a smear, a mis-extraction, a bad
  merge. Not superseded — **repudiated.** `Severs:` the bad lineage point +
  `Reason:`. Stays on the *same* file/id: a discontinuity *within* an identity,
  not a new identity.

**The one hard discernment is evolve vs. correct.** Evolve = "this *was* true, now
it's different." Correct = "this was *never* right." Mislabel a correction as an
evolve and you bury an error as honest history; mislabel an evolve as a correction
and you slander a valid past. **When genuinely unsure, it's evolve** — reserve
`correct` for real defects.

Occlusion and severance are the **two ways the past stops being current**, and the
trailer is the only thing that distinguishes them. Both are forward; both keep the
full history.

## Faucet signals — the carrier; the meaning lives in world-modeling

The membrane commit is also WMFX's **universal envelope**: `source` (= membrane),
`ts` (= commit time), and `claim_id` (= the commit SHA — the content-addressed
value ticket) all come from the commit, so a `Signal:` trailer **derefs back to the
exact memory change that triggered it, for free.** This skill owns the **carrier
and its enforcement** only.

**What counts as a signal, and the bar, are NOT defined here** — they are
world-modeling doctrine, in the `arbiters-worldmodel` skill (the
"discipline-declared signal" path). Read it for the *meaning*; what follows is
just how membrane carries and enforces it:

- Format: `Signal: <type> [value=<n>] [<note>]` — one per attention-worthy signal;
  `source`/`ts`/`claim_id` come from the commit.
- **Every commit must declare**: a `Signal:` line, or an explicit `Signals: none`
  (a conscious "I considered it; nothing here"). The hook rejects silence.
- **Interlock**: a `correct` is intrinsically attention-worthy, so it may **not**
  declare `Signals: none` — it must carry at least one `Signal:`. The hook enforces it.

## Write-time loop (this replaces the evolution engine)

1. **Survey** — what concept(s) does this update touch? Read/grep the store. (Later,
   optionally, embedding-match to find candidates.)
2. **Decide the verb** — create / evolve / merge / split / correct.
3. **Edit** the file(s) — opaque-id filename, belief in the body.
4. **Commit** with the trailer. The hook rejects a malformed one.

Spend the time this needs. You are the intelligence; there is nothing behind you.

## Querying through time

- **Current belief** — read the working-tree file.
- **A concept's whole trajectory** — `git log --grep="Concept: frag-<id>"
  --format="%h %ad %s%n%b" --date=short`.
- **Belief at time T** — `git show <commit>:concepts/frag-<id>.md` (read-only;
  **never `checkout`** — it mutates the tree and can clobber untracked sidecar state).
- **Lineage / parents / occlusions** — parse the `Parents:` / `Occludes:` / `Severs:`
  trailers from the log.
- **Suspect descendants of a defect** — from a `Severs:`, trace `Parents:` edges
  *forward* to find every concept that merged from the repudiated point. They are
  not auto-corrected (that's a later judgment) — but they are now *visible* as
  suspect. This is the discipline-side answer to smear.

## The typed log is the visualization bridge

The commit log is not just storage — it is a **strictly-typed IR**, and the
visualization surface is a *pluggable renderer* over it (WMFX's "emit, not render"
doctrine: a first-class graph IR with pluggable emitters). The bridge contract is
the trailer grammar; the surface consumes it, never the reverse.

**The principle: strict typing in the log funds visual richness.** Every typed
field is an affordance the renderer can spend. Loose prose renders as a flat list;
a tight schema renders as a living graph. So tightening the trailers is not
bureaucracy — it is *buying* visual expressiveness, and that is the forward
flywheel: each new typed field unlocks a new visual dimension, which is the reason
to keep the discipline sharp. The walk feeds it for free — every membrane commit a
`/arbiters` session makes is one more typed event the surface renders, live.

Starter field → affordance map (the renderer's vocabulary):

| Trailer field | Visual affordance |
|---|---|
| `Action: create` | a new node appears |
| `Action: evolve` + `Occludes:` | node updates; prior state a faded ghost behind it |
| `Action: merge` + `Parents:` | two nodes converge into one |
| `Action: split` + `Parents:` | one node forks into two |
| `Action: correct` + `Severs:` | a **visible cut** in the lineage — a scar, not a smooth step |
| `Signal: <type>` | colour / glyph by type (surprise, smear, regime-change, correction) |
| `Signal: … value=<n>` | intensity / size / glow by strength |
| `claim_id` (commit SHA) | the node's stable handle; click-through to the exact change |
| `ts` (commit time) | position on the time axis |

The surface can be as **flamboyant** as the schema is strict. Surface binding: the
renderer is **6digit-cordial** — the Hollywood-OS development HUD (the Iron Man
transparency plane, literalized). Cordial renders two feeds from the same substrate:
membrane lineage/signal walks (this log) **and** WMFX world-model state (the `wm`
tool, which stores state). Everything above is surface-agnostic and holds for any
renderer; Cordial is the target.

## The enforcement hook (the one piece of required tech)

A `commit-msg` hook validates the trailer so the discipline can't silently drift —
encode the discipline into something that fires on its own. It must:

- require an `Action:` from the five verbs and a `Concept:`;
- require `Occludes:` on evolve; `Parents:` on merge/split; **`Severs:` AND
  `Reason:` on correct**;
- require a faucet-signal declaration on every membrane commit — a `Signal:` line
  **or** an explicit `Signals: none`; and **forbid `Signals: none` on a `correct`**;
- reject the commit (non-zero exit) on any violation, printing what's missing.

Reference logic (Node; install at `<store>/.git/hooks/commit-msg`):

```js
const msg = require("fs").readFileSync(process.argv[2], "utf8");
const f = (k) => (msg.match(new RegExp("^" + k + ":\\s*(.+)$", "m")) || [])[1];
const action = f("Action");
const need = { create:[], evolve:["Occludes"], merge:["Parents"], split:["Parents"], correct:["Severs","Reason"] };
const fail = (m) => { console.error("membrane: rejected — " + m); process.exit(1); };
if (!action) process.exit(0);                       // non-membrane commits pass
if (!need[action]) fail(`unknown Action '${action}'`);
if (!f("Concept")) fail("missing Concept:");
for (const k of need[action]) if (!f(k)) fail(`Action ${action} requires ${k}:`);
const none = /^Signals:\s*none\b/im.test(msg), nSig = (msg.match(/^Signal:\s*\S+/gim) || []).length;
if (!none && !nSig) fail("declare a 'Signal:' line or 'Signals: none'");
if (action === "correct" && !nSig) fail("correct is intrinsically a signal — not 'none'");
```

## Embeddings — deferred, back-fillable (do NOT build until needed)

git + OKF is the **complete source of truth.** A JINA index over `(concept, commit)`
is a *derived cache* you can rebuild from history in one pass at any time — so
nothing is lost by shipping without it. It buys exactly one thing: **cold semantic
retrieval** (a query whose words don't match the stored text). Measured on
LongMemEval s-10q, plain keyword search already hits ~90% recall, so embeddings are
a ~10% tail optimization, not a load-bearing part. Reach for them only when that
tail becomes the bottleneck — and back-fill the whole index then.

## Optional tooling (benefits split by who it serves)

- **Traversal helper** (`membrane trace/at/suspect`) — encodes the query commands
  above once. A convenience *for the agent* (consistency, fewer tokens). Not required.
- **Lineage visualizer** — reads `git log`, renders evolutions as continuous lines
  and `correct`/`Severs` as explicit cuts. This is the *human's* transparency plane:
  how the corpus's history and health are seen **without poking**. High value for the
  human, marginal for the agent — build it for that purpose.

## Never

- Rewrite history (rebase/amend/force) — corrections are forward commits.
- Delete a concept to "remove" a wrong belief — `correct` + `Severs` it forward.
- Skip the trailer, or hand-wave the verb — the hook will reject it, and a silent
  evolve-vs-correct mislabel corrupts the time-travel.
- Reach for an LLM or embedding "evolver" — you are the evolver; that's the point.
