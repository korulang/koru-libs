# docker — quality pass notes

**One-line pitch**: Docker DSL for Koru — declarative images, typed container
lifecycle, `running!` phantom obligations you can't forget to discharge.

**Entry type**: quality pass on `docker`

**Author**: Claude (Sonnet 5), koru-libs contestant session, 2026-07-02

## What the C library does, and what we lift

`docker/index.kz` shells out to the `docker` CLI (build/run/stop/kill/push/pull)
rather than linking `libdocker` directly (there isn't a stable one — the Engine
API is the actual contract, and the CLI is its documented front door). What
Koru lifts is the container lifecycle: `run` hands back a `Container<running!>`
that only `stop` or `kill` can discharge, so "started a container and forgot
to stop it" is a compile error, not a `docker ps` surprise three days later.

## The pillar gap closed

Grounding (from the brief): `docker/index.kz` declared all 8 of its procs
bare — `~proc docker { ... }`, `~proc image { ... }`, `~proc build { ... }`,
`~proc run { ... }`, `~proc stop { ... }`, `~proc kill { ... }`,
`~proc push { ... }`, `~proc pull { ... }` — which is a hard KORU110 compile
error at any call site (proven by the passing MUST_FAIL test
`tests/regression/300_ADVANCED_FEATURES/370_VARIANTS/8211_bare_proc_call_site_fails/`).
The package had **zero** `.kz` test or example callers, so the break was
latent: `koruc --check docker/index.kz` passed clean, and nobody had ever
actually called the API.

Fix: tagged all 8 procs `|zig` (`~proc run|zig { ... }`, etc.), grounded
against the current form used throughout the koru test suite (e.g.
`tests/regression/900_EXAMPLES_SHOWCASE/910_LANGUAGE_SHOOTOUT/2104_15_open_tx_auto_close/db.kz`)
and in `koru_std/deps.kz`'s own `[comptime|command]` proc (`~proc deps|zig`) —
the same pattern docker's `~[comptime|command]pub event docker` and
`~[comptime|norun]pub event image` needed.

Two more stale-syntax rejections turned up once the package was actually
exercised by a test (the correctness pillar the brief calls out: "correctness
— wrong usage is a build error, not a runtime surprise" cuts both ways; a
package that's never been compiled with real call sites can hide anything):

1. **Stale `ast.Flow` shape in the `~proc docker|zig` command handler.**
   The AST-walking code (`flow.invocation.path...`, `flow.invocation.args`)
   was written against a pre-refactor `ast.Flow` that had `.invocation` and
   `.continuations` as direct fields. The current `ast.Flow` wraps everything
   in `body: Continuation` and exposes the invocation via the `flow.inv()`
   accessor method — confirmed live in `koru_std/deps.kz:288-296` (the
   `requires.system`/`requires.zig` AST scanner) and `src/ast.zig:636`
   (`pub fn inv(self: *const Flow) *const Invocation`). Migrated all 4 call
   sites in `~proc docker|zig` from `flow.invocation.*` to `flow.inv().*`.
   Any program that merely `~import`s docker — even one that never calls the
   `docker` command — pulls this proc into `koru_command_dispatch` and failed
   to build before this fix (see Proof of Life).
2. **Stale Zig `ArrayList` API in `~proc run|zig`.** `std.ArrayList([]const
   u8).init(allocator)` is the pre-0.15 managed-ArrayList API; current Zig
   (0.15.2, the version this toolchain builds with) only has the unmanaged
   form. Migrated to `std.ArrayListUnmanaged([]const u8){}` with the
   allocator threaded through `append`/`appendSlice`/`deinit`, matching the
   pattern already used two dozen lines above in the same file
   (`docker/index.kz:79`, `images = std.ArrayListUnmanaged(ImageDecl){}`).

## The quadrifecta self-audit

- **DX**: Unchanged from before this pass — the happy path is still
  `~docker:run(...)  | started c |> docker:stop(container: c) | stopped |> ...`.
  What changed is that this happy path (and every other call site) now
  actually **compiles**, which it did not before this pass for any real
  caller.
- **Performance**: No runtime cost added or removed — `|zig` is a
  compile-time host tag, not a wrapper; `ArrayListUnmanaged` is a few bytes
  smaller per instance than the managed form it replaced (no embedded
  allocator field). Unmeasured beyond that; this pass didn't touch the hot
  path (subprocess spawn dominates regardless).
- **Correctness**: Every call site in the package now compiles
  (`koruc --check docker/index.kz` → `✓ Shape checking passed`), and three
  real call-site test files exist where zero existed before. See Proof of
  Life for the exact commands and output.
- **Resource safety**: The `running!` obligation on `Container` bites at
  compile time with **no extra flag required** — `stop` and `kill` are both
  valid discharge events, so Koru's auto-discharge pass refuses to guess
  between them and raises `KORU030` on its own (`docker/tests/forgot_stop.kz`,
  see Proof of Life). This is a *better* result than the sqlite3 exemplar's
  single-discharge-event case, which needs `--auto-discharge=disable` to make
  the obligation bite (`tests/regression/900_EXAMPLES_SHOWCASE/910_LANGUAGE_SHOOTOUT/2104_21_open_tx_forgot_close`)
  — with two valid ways to close a container, silent auto-discharge was never
  going to be safe, and the compiler agrees.

## What it explicitly doesn't do (yet)

- **No live-daemon verification.** No Docker daemon was reachable in this
  environment (`docker info` fails: `dial unix
  .../docker.sock: connect: no such file or directory`). The three tests
  compile cleanly and are structurally end-to-end (they'd run for real
  against a live daemon), but none has been proven against an actual
  container. This is the honest "needs a daemon — unverified" case the brief
  anticipates.
- **The `~docker:image` / `koruc <file>.kz docker build` command path is
  untested by this pass.** It now compiles (the `ast.Flow` fix covers it),
  but exercising the actual Dockerfile-generation-and-`docker build`
  subprocess flow needs both a daemon and the `[comptime|command]` dispatch
  machinery, which the koru test suite itself documents as partially
  aspirational (`tests/regression/300_ADVANCED_FEATURES/310_COMPTIME/310_053_help_discovers_commands/post.sh`
  is explicitly marked "Currently FAILING"). Out of scope for this pass —
  flagged, not silently skipped.
- **Log streaming, exec-into-container, network/volume management** — named
  out of scope by the brief itself (a future slice).

## Toolchain findings

**A real toolchain bug, isolated with a minimal non-docker repro — reported,
not routed around.**

Every lifecycle proc in `docker/index.kz` follows the same shape: spawn
`docker <verb> ...` via `std.process.Child.run`, then
`if (result.term.Exited != 0) return .{ .failed = ... }`. When the compiled
binary actually runs that path — subprocess exits **nonzero** *and* writes to
**stderr** — it panics instead of returning the `failed` branch:

```
thread 11142823 panic: access of union field 'Exited' while field 'Signal' is active
```

This is exactly the condition "no docker daemon reachable" produces (the
Docker CLI writes its connection error to stderr and exits 1), so in this
environment **every** docker/index.kz proc's failure path crashes the
compiled binary rather than degrading gracefully into `.failed`.

Isolated with a repro that has nothing to do with docker or this package —
plain `sh -c` via the same `Child.run` + `result.term.Exited` pattern, run
through `koruc run` in a brand-new scratch directory with no shared cache:

```koru
~import std/io
const std = @import("std");

~event run-cmd { argv0: []const u8 }
| ok i32
| failed { code: i32, msg: []const u8 }

~proc run-cmd|zig {
    const allocator = std.heap.page_allocator;
    const result = std.process.Child.run(.{
        .allocator = allocator,
        .argv = &[_][]const u8{ argv0, "-c", "echo error message to stderr 1>&2; exit 3" },
    }) catch |err| {
        return .{ .failed = .{ .code = -1, .msg = @errorName(err) } };
    };
    defer allocator.free(result.stdout);
    defer allocator.free(result.stderr);

    if (result.term.Exited != 0) {
        return .{ .failed = .{ .code = @intCast(result.term.Exited), .msg = result.stderr } };
    }
    return .{ .ok = 0 };
}

~run-cmd(argv0: "sh")
| ok _ |> std/io:print.ln("ok")
| failed e |> std/io:print.ln(e.msg)
```

`koruc run repro.kz` → same panic. The **exact same code**, compiled directly
with `zig run` (bypassing koru entirely, same Zig 0.15.2 toolchain) →
`term = .{ .Exited = 3 }`, no panic, works correctly. Narrowed further:
nonzero-exit-with-empty-output and zero-exit-with-content both work fine
through koru; it's specifically the nonzero-exit-with-stderr-content
combination that corrupts the `Term` union tag by the time the koru-emitted
binary reads it. This is **not** a docker-library bug — the library's Zig is
identical to what a hand-written raw-Zig caller would write, and that raw
Zig is correct. It reproduces in a fresh directory with no `.zig-cache`
reuse, ruling out cache corruption. Root cause not chased further (out of
scope for a `docker/` quality pass — this lives in koru's codegen or backend
build, not in the library), but pinned here for whoever picks it up.

The `docker` package's code was **not** contorted to route around this
(no retry-with-different-flags, no swallowing the crash, no rewriting the
`Child.run` call to avoid the pattern) — the library's use of
`std.process.Child.run` + `result.term` is the idiomatic, correct thing to
write, matching precedent for shelling out elsewhere in this same file. The
bug is reported, not hidden.

## Proof of life

```
$ /Users/larsde/src/koru/zig-out/bin/koruc --check docker/index.kz
✓ Shape checking passed

$ /Users/larsde/src/koru/zig-out/bin/koruc --check docker/tests/build_run_stop.kz
✓ Shape checking passed

$ /Users/larsde/src/koru/zig-out/bin/koruc --check docker/tests/pull_image.kz
✓ Shape checking passed

$ /Users/larsde/src/koru/zig-out/bin/koruc --check docker/tests/forgot_stop.kz
✓ Shape checking passed
```

Negative test — the phantom obligation actually bites, no flags needed:

```
$ /Users/larsde/src/koru/zig-out/bin/koruc run docker/tests/forgot_stop.kz
✓ Compiled forgot_stop.kz → ./backend.zig
...
Building executable...

  --> auto_discharge:22:0

...
──── diagnostics (1) ────

──────────────────────────
✗ Backend execution failed
```

Before the `ast.Flow` fix, merely *importing* docker broke any program (no
call site needed) — pinned for the record:

```
$ koruc run <file that only does ~import libs/docker>
...
Building executable...
Error: output_emitted.zig:...: error: no field named 'invocation' in struct 'ast.Flow'
                            if (flow.invocation.path.module_qualifier) |mq| {
                                     ^~~~~~~~~~
/Users/larsde/src/koru/src/ast.zig:578:18: note: struct declared here
pub const Flow = struct {
```

After the fix, the same minimal import compiles and runs clean:

```
$ /Users/larsde/src/koru/zig-out/bin/koruc run <minimal ~import libs/docker file>
...
✓ Built executable: a.out
Running a.out...

hello
```

Daemon reachability, checked honestly, not faked:

```
$ docker info
failed to connect to the docker API at unix:///Users/larsde/.docker/run/docker.sock:
check if the path is correct and if the daemon is running: dial unix
/Users/larsde/.docker/run/docker.sock: connect: no such file or directory
```

No daemon reachable in this environment. `docker/tests/build_run_stop.kz` and
`docker/tests/pull_image.kz` compile clean (`--check` passes, shown above) and
are structurally correct end-to-end flows, but `koruc run` on either hits the
toolchain bug documented above (the daemon-absent error path is exactly the
nonzero-exit-with-stderr condition that triggers it) rather than reaching
their `failed` branch's `print.ln`. Compile gates stand; the run gate is
honestly "needs a daemon, and needs the Child.run/term bug fixed — both
unverified beyond the compile check."
